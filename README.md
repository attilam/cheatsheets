# Cheat Sheets

Usually I create cheat sheets when I learn a new program or programming language.

The idea is that I'll remember things more because I've written them down. Many times if I don't know something I remember vaguely where it was in the cheat sheet at least.

These specific docs are probably not useful for everyone (or anyone else beside me?), but I definitely think the idea of making them for yourself is solid.

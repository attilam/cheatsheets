## LearnSquared tips

- Create (pattern) brushes to use with strokes
- Create pattern brushes, draw something with them, create pattern brush from that, repeat for fractal madness
- Use the Blend tool to create a repeating pattern, then give it a spine to wrap around a circle for example.
- Use the Path Finder tool to do boolean operations. Don't forget to hit Expand to clean geometry

## Navigation/View

`MMB` - Orbit  
  -> `Shift` - Pan  
  -> `Ctrl` - Zoom  

`Num0` - Camera/Scene view  
`Num5` - Persp/Ortho  
`Num1/3/7/9` - different ortho views  
`Num.` - Zoom Extents  
`Num/` - Toggle Global/Local mode ("solo"/"exclusive" mode for edited object)  

`Home` - view camera center (to fill 3d vp with camera clip)  

`Ctrl+Alt+Num0` - move active camera to current viewport view  

`Z` - toggle wireframe mode  
`Shift+Z` - Toggle viewport render mode  

`Shift+Space` & `Ctrl+UpArrow` & `Ctrl+DownArrow` - Toggle Maximize for active view  

Properties Panel (`N`) -> `Lock camera to view` - to move active camera with 3d viewport commands  

## Selection

`Shift+A` - Add Menu  

`F6` - View operator panel for current tool as popup  

`tab` - toggle object/edit mode  

`A` - toggle selection  

`Shift+G` - Select Grouped Menu (e.g. parent, children, same type, color, layer, ...)  
`Ctrl+G` - create new Group  
`Ctrl+Shift+G` - add all objects to active object's group  

`Alt+RMB` - Select Menu (lists of all objects under cursor)

`C` - circle (brush) selection, scrollwheel to set brush size

`H` - hide selected  
`Shift+H` - set restrict view (hide others)  
`Alt+H` - clear restrict view  

`X` - delete/dissolve  
  -> in object mode doesn't delete children! use outliner menu!  
  -> also try Limited Dissolve to decimate polygons by angle  
`Ctrl+X` - Dissolve Selected  

`M` - Move to Layer Menu

### Edit mode selection

`Ctrl+RMB` - select vertex/edge/face path (after 1 item already selected)  
`Alt+RMB` - select vertex/edge/face loop (mouse direction to item midpoint decides loop orientation) 

`L` - select linked (cumulative)  
`Ctrl+L` - select all connected  
`Shift+G` - select similar  

## Transformation

`Ctrl+space` - Toggle 3D manipulator (Pie)  
  -> `Shift+LMB Drag` - on a manipulator axis transforms on perpendicular plane to axis  
`Alt+space` - Transformation Orientation Menu  

`G` - grab/move  
  -> `G` - again to "edge slide" vertices!  
`R` - rotate (press twice for trackball rotation)  
`S` - scale  
`Ctrl+M` - mirror  
  -> `X,Y,Z` - constrain to single axis  
  -> `Shift+X,Y,Z` - add constraint axis to transform on a plane  
    -> double tap axis keys to toggle local/global  
    -> type in numbers to specify exact transformation along selected axis  

With a camera selected enter Camera View (`Num0`), and the transform tools can be used to tweak it easily.  

To move/rotate/scale on a plane interactively hold `Shift` while dragging the arrow handle corresponding to the _normal_ of the plane.  

### Pivot

`shit+TAB` - toggle snap  
`Shift+S` - Snap Menu (snaps either selection, or cursor)

`T` - set keyframe interpolation mode  

`Alt+A` - play/pause animation  
`Shift+left/right` - go to first/last frame of animation  

## Node Editor

`Alt+C` - Convert to (mesh/curves, in object mode)  

`F12` - Render  

`E` (w. mouse over a control) - Pick value for control in viewport (e.g. for Depth of Field Distance, etc.)

## Misc stuff

- Objects are transforms that reference Data blocks (mesh, materials, etc)
  - the same Data can be referenced by multiple Objects (i.e. instantiating)
  - Data with 0-references gets deleted upon save/reopen
  - add a Fake User to keep 0-ref Data (via the F button in properties)

- _Hover_ over any control and `Ctrl+C` to copy, or `Ctrl+V` to paste value (even colors!)

- Blender's config file is just a scene file, so a way to migrate settings is to open it in the new Blender version

- use the Edge Split modifier to smooth object via angle (i.e. "smoothing groups"/faceting)
- or use Auto Smooth on the data tab of the selected object

- Make use of the fact that you can type in numbers for interactive transform tool
  - e.g. `S` `Z` `0` to flatten something in Z, or `R` `Y` `90` to rotate 90ยบ in Y

- UV Mapping Menu
  - press Reset, then Follow Active Quads to neatly layout selected faces

- Straighten Edges according to normals
  - select edges (e.g. `ctrl+RMB` for a path)
  - set Transformation Orientation (3D View) to "Normal"
  - set Pivot Center (3D View) to "Individual Origins"
  - press `S` (for scale), and `Z` `Z` (to scale along local Z, i.e. normal direction), then `0` (to scale to 0)

- use the Skin modifier to quickly build organic models, similarly to zbrush
  - in a mesh object extrude points (`Ctrl+LMB`) to build skinned branching structures
  - press `Ctrl+A` to scale vertices (i.e. skin thickness)
- select 2 vertices and use 'Select Vertex Path' (`W` menu) to select all the edges between them (cool to mark UV seams for example)
- the border of the camera view is selectable like any object, transform tools work on it!

- use Select -> Select All by Trait -> Loose Geometry to help clean up your models

- use the `Auto Merge` button in 3D View to automatically merge vertices that are moved together

- Bake AO
  - create a new Image map in the UV/Image Editor
  - go to Edit Mode, in UV Mapping Select Unwrap/Lightmap Pack to create UV if necessary
  - link image to UV in UV/Image Editor by browsing to it at the bottom
  - back in Object Mode go to the World tab to setup AO for rendering
    - enable Ambient Occlusion
    - in Gather set Samples to desired amount to keep noise down
    - in Gather tweak Attenuation and Falloff Strength to adjust AO smoothness
  - on the Render tab open the Bake dropdown
    - set Bake Mode to Ambient Occlusion
    - check Normalized
    - set desired Margin
  - press Bake
  - in UV/Image Editor select Image/Save as Image to save the map

- Dynamic Paint Procedural "Tech" Carving
  - create a model as "canvas" and another as "brush"
  - add Dynamic Paint Modifier to both
  - on the Dynamics tab enable Dynamic Paint with the respectable setting for each
  - on the Canvas object
    - in Dynamic Paint Add Canvas, and set Surface Type to Weight
    - on the Data tab new Vertex Group with the same name as the Dynamic Paint Output
    - add a Mask modifier and use the created vertex group as input (invert if needed)
    - optionally use the Solidify modifier on the result
  - on the Brush object
    - turn off editor and camera visibility
    - use tricks, like Displacement modifier with a procedural texture for more interesting looks
